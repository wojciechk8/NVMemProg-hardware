Main board:
- Add U33, R39-R42, C35, C38, C39 to the pcb
- Separate VPP and VCC switches by connecting second part of U63
  (replace DC_OK with D input of the U63)
- Additional linear regulator for VPP (ability to set lower voltages)
- Maybe better DC-DC converters (higher freq, smaller)
- Lower output currents (250mA for VCC, 125mA for VPP)
- Remove DC_IN circuit (only USB powered)
- Add soft start to meet USB power requirements (max. 100mA at power-up)
  (this could be solved together with DC converters redesign)


Driver board:
- Screw holes at the corners
- Add serial resistors to C1, C2


Common:
- Better connectors (maybe SMD) between main and driver board
- Move pcb design to pcb-rnd
