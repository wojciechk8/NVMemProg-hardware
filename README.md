# NVMemProg --- Non-Volatile Memory Programmer

This design is an universal memory programmer with USB 2.0 (high-speed mode) interface
to a host PC, 48 independent universal pin drivers, 2 power lines (VCC, VPP) and an ability to generate
arbitrary digital waveforms with the maximum speed of 24MHz.


**WARNING!**
There are missing components on the pcb, due to a mistake, which was
corrected only in the schematics. See TODO for more information.
