## Simulations
* io — I/O path of memory pins
* pwr — power supply circuits

To run a simulation use the script provided:  
```
./simulate [schematic].sch
```

*The simulations were tested with ngspice-26. The I/O simulations don't work with ngspice-27.*

## Calculations
The worksheet files contain calculations which were carrying out during design.
